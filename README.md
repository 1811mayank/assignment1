Problem 1
  part 1 :First i have greb ' " 200' from web-server.log and than i count the no. of lines by wc -l
  part 2 :First i get column 9 by space seprated in web-server.log by command awk '{ print $9 }'.
          than sort than and count the uniq values.
Problem 2
  I have created hello.txt file and i am appending "hello" in that file.
  Now i checked the hello append command process is stopped, if it is stopped than again i am appending hello.
  This step continuesly repeating in loop so that the hello word appending process never stooped.
